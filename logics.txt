Analogy
=======
Identity of relation
- relations among ordered pairs

Reasoning by ananlogy is a process of, from a given pair (x, f(x)),
extrapolating the function f.

Language is about the description and relation of objects.
These descriptions and relations modeled by predicates.

On a higher level individual propositions may be taken as objects.
Descriptions (modifiers) and relations of propositions are
   currently modeled by different methods.

   Descriptives
      Negation
      Modal Logics (Modal, contrary to fact)
         Alethic
         Deontic
         Epistemic/Doxastic
         Temporal
      Frequency
         In some times/cases, P
      Source
         personal opinion
         another person
         etc.

   Relations
      Truth-Functional Relations (purely logical)

      Bimodal Logic
                        closed  
         Probability       *
         Obligation        *
         Belief            *
         Before/After
         Frequent          *
         Confidence        *

         Probability( P > Q )     Probability( P = Q )     <>
         Obligatory( P > Q )      Obligatory( P = Q )      []
         Belief( P > Q )          Belief( P = Q )          <>
         Temporal( P > Q )        Temporal( P = Q )
         Frequency( P > Q )       Frequency( P = Q )
         Confidence( P > Q )      Confidence( P = Q )
         
         Pleasure(
            contentment/euphoria/delight

      Causal
         P caused Q
            Dynamic Logic
            [a]P, after event a, it's necessarily that P.
            <a>P, after event a, it's possible that P.

      Spacial Relations
         P occurred within inter-causal distance from Q
         Q occurred outside of causal distance from Q


Language is used to construct models.
